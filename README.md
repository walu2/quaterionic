# Quaternionic

Welcome to my "Quaternionic" gem!
Its small-tailored-to-needs gem adding Quaternion classes with theirs all mathematican properties to Ruby's namespace.

Motivation for creating this was so specific syntax used in my pet-project Ruby game, where all existing gems (not too much) were not suitable :(
Big thank to author of official Python cool implementation [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Quaternion] where - based on that some parts of this code are just based.
